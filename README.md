MIND MAP AI

Overview

Mind Map AI is an interactive web application that helps users organize ideas visually. It uses draggable nodes and connections. 
Users can create mind map nodes by typing or using voice commands. They can also connect related ideas on a canvas.
The project runs entirely on the client side and aims to improve brainstorming and idea visualization using modern browser tools.

Features

- Create mind map nodes using text input
- Create nodes with voice commands using the Web Speech API
- Visually connect nodes to show relationships
- Drag and drop nodes with real-time line updates
- Export the complete mind map as an image (PNG)
- Interactive and user-friendly canvas interface

Tech Stack

Frontend

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Libraries / APIs

- Web Speech API (voice recognition)
- html2canvas (export canvas as image)
- SVG (for dynamic connection lines)

How It Works

Users can add nodes manually or through voice input. 

Nodes are placed on a canvas and can be dragged freely. 

A connection mode allows users to link two nodes with SVG lines. 

Connections automatically adjust when nodes move. 

The whole mind map can be saved as an image for future use.

Project Status-Completed  

All planned main features have been implemented and tested in the browser.

Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with browser APIs (Web Speech API)
- DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript
- Implementing drag-and-drop functionality from scratch
- Dynamic SVG rendering and coordinate calculations
- Building interactive UI logic without external frameworks

Limitations & Future Improvements

- No backend or database support (data is not saved)
- Mind maps are session-based

Future enhancements could include:

- User authentication
- Saving mind maps to a database
- AI-assisted topic expansion
- Cloud-based storage and sharing
